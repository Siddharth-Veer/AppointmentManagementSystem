# Appointment Management System

This is a basic appointment management system built with React, Node.js, and MongoDB.

## Getting Started

### Backend

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install backend dependencies.
3. Create a `.env` file with your MongoDB URI: 
4. Start the backend server with `npm run dev`.

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install frontend dependencies.
3. Start the frontend server with `npm start`.

## Overview

### Introduction
In order to effectively handle appointments for hospitals, our project aims to create a user-friendly React website. Online scheduling of appointments, history of appointments, and reminders are all conveniently accessible to patients. The ability to examine patient details, schedule appointments, and manage hospital operations will all be facilitated by this system for hospital staff.

### Technology Description

**Frontend: React**
React has a robust, component-based architecture and renders quickly, making it an excellent choice for creating dynamic, responsive user interfaces. This indicates that maintaining and reusing the user interface's components will be simple. React makes use of a virtual DOM to improve speed of updates and user experience, especially in highly interactive apps. Furthermore, React offers a vast community as well as a multitude of libraries and tools that help speed up and simplify the development process.

**Backend: Node.js and Express**
Node.js with Express is used for its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, which is well-suited for handling multiple simultaneous requests, crucial for a scheduling system. This setup enables high performance and scalability, essential for applications expecting a significant number of concurrent users. Express, a minimalist web framework for Node.js, provides robust routing and middleware options, simplifying the creation of a RESTful API. Together, they form a powerful backend that can efficiently manage the server-side logic and database interactions.

**Database: MongoDB**
MongoDB is selected for its flexible schema design, which allows for easy scaling and quick iterations. Its document-based nature aligns well with the data structures used in the application, enabling efficient storage and retrieval of data. MongoDB's ability to handle large volumes of unstructured data makes it suitable for diverse medical records and appointment details. Additionally, its powerful querying and indexing capabilities support rapid development and enhance performance.
